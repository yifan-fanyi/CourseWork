### do some error trapping:

assert human_binary.shape[0] == num_sequences, 'Error: the number of sequences was entered incorrectly'
assert human_binary.shape[1] == sequence_length, 'Error: the length of the seqeunces is incorrect'

# the with statement opens the file, does the business, and close it up for us...
with h5py.File(DATA_FNAME, 'w') as hf:
    hf.create_dataset('human_binary', data = human_binary)
    ## note you can write several data arrays into one hdf5 file, just give each a different name.

###################
# Let's read it back from the file and then check to make sure it is as we wrote...
with h5py.File(DATA_FNAME, 'r') as hf:
    hb_copy = hf['human_binary'][:]

### this will throw and error if they are not the same...
np.testing.assert_array_equal(human_binary, hb_copy)
